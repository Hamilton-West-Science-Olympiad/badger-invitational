## About the Tournament

This is a division B and C tournament organized by Hamilton/Madison West
Science Olympiad.

The 6th Badger Invitational will be held on February 27, 2021. 

We will use the **MiniSO format**, but with the addition of **video 
submission for some build events:** Mission Possible B, Mousetrap 
Vehicle B, and Gravity Vehicle C. Boomilever and Wright Stuff will be 
offered as trial events.

In addition to the Nationals slate of events, we will also run the 
additional Wisconsin events: Code Analysis C, Code Busters B, Virtual 
Geocaching B/C, Mystery Build B/C, Solar Power B/C, and Virology B/C.

We take pride in providing tests written by people from UW-Madison, 
Science Olympad Alumni and other similar experts. Coaches will not be 
asked to provide a test.
